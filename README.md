# 3D Terrain Generator

## Abstract
This is a C++ implementation of a 3D Terrain Generator using Perlin Simplex
Noise. The resulting terrain is based on a height map and a moisture map. Using 
the two metrics, a biomes table can be defined.

The scope of this repository is only to generate the terrain, not to display it 
nor use it in an actual program like a game. Future updates may include a way to
visualize the terrain and other metrics for more biome diversification.
